            <p>Upon matriculating at <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>
            in Medford, Massachusetts, I had no idea
            what I wanted to pursue. I took nearly every "Intro to..." class I
            could find, including, but not limited to: Economics, Sociology,
            Psychology, Cognitive &amp; Brain Sceinces, Philosophy, and Computer Science,
            plus I dabbled in French, and some Calculus. One decision I did make, though, was to
            walk onto the swim team, which turned out to be one of the greatest
            experiences of my college career.</p>

            <p>A year later, as the deadline to
            declare a major grew nearer, I finally settled on <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/undergraduate/concCognitive.htm">Cognitive and Brain
            Sciences (CBS)</a>. CBS is technically a branch of the Psychology department, 
            though it has its own inter-departmental steering committee, including
            professors from the psychology, philosophy, child development, and
            computer science departments. As someone who had trouble declaring
            a major at all, I enjoyed the opportunity to take all these interesting
            classes in different departments across the university. Additionally,
            this major pushed me to explore Computer Science, something I 
            never would have gravitated towards without this push; the following 
            semester, I decided to minor in CS.</p>

            <p> In January of my junior year, I
            left to study at the Danish Institute for Study Abroad in Copenhagen,
            Denmark in the Child Diversity and Development program. After 4 months
            of gallavanting around Europe, working with small Scandinavian viking-children,
            and amassing a

                It's often compared with "cozy," but this is incomplete, I'm told.
                Too simple. It's a feeling of contentment. It's about intimacy and
                candlelight and is one of the great pleasures of social life in Denmark."

            collection of scarves, candles, and Carlsberg paraphernalia,
            I returned to the states ready to tackle my senior year. As I took
            more advanced CS classes, I started to take a real interest in the field.
            In my final semester, I made a last-minute decision to declare CS
            as my second major, pushing my graduation date back from Spring '15 to 
            Summer '15 to finish one last class (thank you, Computational Theory).</p>
